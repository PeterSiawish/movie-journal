        <h2>Hi There!</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! 👋 I'm a tech enthusiast and movie lover who enjoys
          exploring how technology is portrayed on screen - from AI gone rogue
          to underdog coders changing the world. Whether it's an exciting
          documentary or a thrilling hacker film, I love how these stories make
          us think, dream, and sometimes laugh nervously at how real it all
          feels.
        </p>
